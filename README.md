# Ai-Text-Score-Prediction-Model
I trained a model using hours studied and hours slept to determine the score on a test.

The project uses hours studied and hours slept, along with a csv, to determine test scores. The variables on line twelve can be altered to get a different output, with the first digit being hours studied and the second being hours slept.
